# CodeKata
CodeKata project for SafeAuto

Code Kata is a .NET Console Application that reads an input file and prints out the information.

## How to use
You can edit the [inputFile.txt](https://github.com/HugoIracheta/CodeKata/blob/main/inputFile.txt) contained in the project and add more trips or more drivers, then you run the project and the output with the required information will appear in a Console window

## The [inputFile.txt](https://github.com/HugoIracheta/CodeKata/blob/main/inputFile.txt)

Each line in the input file will start with a command. There are two possible commands.
The first command is Driver, which will register a new Driver in the app. Example: Driver
Dan The second command is Trip, which will record a trip attributed to a driver. The line
is space delimited with the following fields: the command (Trip), driver name, start
time, stop time, miles driven. Times are in the format of hours:minutes.

## Release
You can just download the [1.0.0. release](https://github.com/HugoIracheta/CodeKata/releases/tag/1.0.0) if you just want to use the project.
